#### The game has two various difficulty levels, which are an easy one and a tricky one. In the easy one, the player will be given plenty of power-ups, shields, and air force supports. It is easy to defeat the final boss, then win the game. But in the tricky one, there are few items for picking up. A new feature only for this difficulty is that players can gain 1 unit for HP through pick up a shield. Additionally, the durability for the shield is not able to cumulate, it will refresh if the player gets a new buffer, but that for power-ups and air force support times can be accumulative.
#### In the game, there are only two types of enemies, which are UFOs and the final boss. But, it has five different levels, which has different enemy logic. In level one, UFOs will only move from right to left and only shoot toward the left boundary. In level two, UFOs will shoot toward the left and left top. In level three, UFOs will shoot toward the left, left top, and left bottom. In level four, UFOs will randomly move and bounce back when if they reach the boundary. In the final stage, the final boss will show up and randomly move in its unique edge.
#### The different player has different images and attacking ways. The submarines attack enemies with missiles from left to right, and it also has weapons toward the right top and right bottom with power-ups. The warship attacks the enemies with top-down bullets. It can also send rockets to the left bottom and right bottom with power-ups. Air force support is a brilliant weapon carrying full-screen top-down shots. But it can only be used when the number of support is higher than zero.
